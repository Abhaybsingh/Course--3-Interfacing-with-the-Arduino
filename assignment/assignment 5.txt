Arduino - Remotely Open Door via Web with Pattern Password



*****************************************
The wifi connection is needed at the place of arduino where it is placed through the wifi shield, I can use the web application to unlock my door.
*****************************************

COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES
1) Arduino UNO & Genuino UNO
2) PHPoC WiFi Shield 2 for Arduino
3) PHPoC 4-port Relay Board
4) Electromagnetic Lock

How it Works

**Open the door
The password is checked by Arduino.
If password is correct, user can rotate the door handle on web.
Web send command to unlock the door to Arduino.
Arduino control Relay to deactivate EM lock


**Wiring
Stack PHPoC WiFi shield on Arduino
Stack Relay shield on PHPoC Shield
Connect EM lock to Relay Shield
In relay shield, move jumper to set relay works as NC (Normal Closed) mode


**How To
Compile Arduino code and upload to Arduino Uno
Upload door.php to PHPoC WiFi Shield via this instruction
Access web page of door: http://192.168.0.234/door.php (you need to replace your PHPoC Shield's IP address)
Draw the pattern to get the access permission
Rotate the door handle to open the door
